Limit nearby to some number of calls? 
 - load more pull up ?

make range work

nice no venues / map / favs views

sections on tableview

design a few things for overall appearance

fav people get twitter / FSQ ? -- at least # checkins or friends.. or take it out ?

do some 3G testing for NYC and other spots 

-----


Take out fav people? or make it a friends tab  ?
 - i think its OK since we're querying a lot of venues.
 - clearly explain it ? -- or make it pending requests ?

limit for if there's 500 venues , or 500 people at an event... sort people too ?

make range slider work?
 - see if changing range affects the API results, if not, just re-display and filter the results

nice views for no venues / map / favs

///loading fav venues and nearby uses 2 HUDs.. make requests cancellable ? or use one HUD ?

Fav venues got totally fucked up when messing with girls/guys and Categories
 - remove from superviews

unify favVenues and nearby into one call loop ... notify for when done getting favs, and nearby.
 - fixes HUD issue , 
 - might cut down on total calls if some are dupes
 
 make a timeRefreshed on the FSVenue, then once unified, refresh every now and again,
  - expire venues even if data is populated... if people are checking in you want it to be fresh.
 the loading portion can be for each tab depending on model.isFavoritesLoading ? 


show favs on map if nearby ?

Pick Favs Controller:
 - sections for table view 
 - get all data initially so type filtering works better 



///cover case where venue has the data, but needs to be displayed

///maybe unify Model.favoriteVenues with favoritesController.venuesArray.. they should be the same right ?


/// - filter typing last cell is funky--- need 'Search Online Cell'
/// - some metadata like dist or address ?  
//// - design some temp tabs
/// - show what are already favs... 
/// - show 'Add' button -- or a plus ?

////no auth state for cancelled,, just one big screen ?

//// logout of foursquare in settings

////auth pop-up, put bar at bottom, use HUD when loading 

//// gender pref doesnt need reload network , just display again
