better icon

design user detail if any -- "add as friend" , a few other stats, maybe friends ?

user detail has to be spiffed, esp if i take out fav people

fav people get twitter / FSQ ? -- at least # checkins or friends.. or take it out ?
-----
user detail:
 anyone: 
  - # checkins
  - # mutual friends, # total friends
    -- mutual friend list
  - twitter
  - facebook possibly
    -- get photos on FB ?
  - 'add as friend'

 
 friends: 
  - last checkin 
  - friends list ? or mutual friends? 
  - phone number 
  - email 
  - unfriend
  

venue detail with tweets:
search for: 4sq.com "electric factory"


----- v 1.5 ...

Limit nearby to some number of calls?  -- its limited to 50 anyway.... but maybe top 30 ?

popular spots instead of clicking map... settings and on map page ?

think a little about the category situation.. ie, making a call first ?-- internet matching ?

** didBecomeActive needs to have a date refresh

instead of 'Nearby' change to 'People Out' ? -- with people icons

map no venues / -- a ruby style alert that says 'tap and hold' type

"last refreshed 2:54" on pull downs

focus on sorting before you load the data... if it has lat lngs already ? what to sort by,,, on 3g you want to see stuff right away ?
- see if using the nearby and then sorting by hereNow gives more than trending 

include user location in Rect only if within 10 miles or so ?
* show favs on map only if within certain radius ?

alert for API limit ? 
 - i can check headers on an error... 'Looks like we've run out of API requests'

do some 3G testing for NYC and other spots 
 -- add arbitrary pause in there

Conditions met, hasReceivedLocation.. stopping 
 - happens cuz of 4 second delay to stop... make sure nothing bad happens here



///make range work
////numbers on map dont update when you change gender pref

/// directions - 'leave app for directions' -- not sure anyone would ever use this

/// design settings page
//// sections on tableview for picker ?
/// bug of when the scroll view is too short, ignore refreshes from 
//// - also turn off UI inter when no venues

////map pins animate too much ... each display

//// mouse down on labels and profile images
////make thumbs have lighter BG, not black before loading image
///default icon on the category type

//// venue detail dont allow 'show details' on callout
/////tweak light on bottom bar in venue detail
///// make other venuepeopledetail use new detail
///timer on pull to refresh a little better
//// design a few things for overall appearance
/// nice no venues /
///favs views
///hanging calls seem to happen a lot.. favs 
//// 'tap to add favs' like beluga

Take out fav people? or make it a friends tab  ?
 - i think its OK since we're querying a lot of venues.
 - clearly explain it ? -- or make it pending requests ?

limit for if there's 500 venues , or 500 people at an event... sort people too ?

make range slider work?
 - see if changing range affects the API results, if not, just re-display and filter the results

nice views for no venues / map / favs

///loading fav venues and nearby uses 2 HUDs.. make requests cancellable ? or use one HUD ?

Fav venues got totally fucked up when messing with girls/guys and Categories
 - remove from superviews

unify favVenues and nearby into one call loop ... notify for when done getting favs, and nearby.
 - fixes HUD issue , 
 - might cut down on total calls if some are dupes
 
 make a timeRefreshed on the FSVenue, then once unified, refresh every now and again,
  - expire venues even if data is populated... if people are checking in you want it to be fresh.
 the loading portion can be for each tab depending on model.isFavoritesLoading ? 


show favs on map if nearby ?

Pick Favs Controller:
 - sections for table view 
 - get all data initially so type filtering works better 



///cover case where venue has the data, but needs to be displayed

///maybe unify Model.favoriteVenues with favoritesController.venuesArray.. they should be the same right ?


/// - filter typing last cell is funky--- need 'Search Online Cell'
/// - some metadata like dist or address ?  
//// - design some temp tabs
/// - show what are already favs... 
/// - show 'Add' button -- or a plus ?

////no auth state for cancelled,, just one big screen ?

//// logout of foursquare in settings

////auth pop-up, put bar at bottom, use HUD when loading 

//// gender pref doesnt need reload network , just display again
